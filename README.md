# Titanic-survival-prediction-using-Machine-Learning-IPython-Notebooks-
I have tried to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various techniques and machine learning algorithms. This is currently a on-going competition on Kaggle and I have got a best score of 0.83253 (top 2%) out of 11262 teams. I will be making modifications to improve the score.
